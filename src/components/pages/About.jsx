      <b><i>I am</i></b> a bit late in the game of coding, but it is never to
      late to teach an old dog new tricks! ha! I touched upon HTML over 20 years
      ago, trying to build a website for my mom and I. We wanted to sell items
      we made. I was also finishing college and got my degree in Exercise
      Science and Nutrition. Guess you could say, life got in the way and never
      finish it. Since then I did personal training besides working out, and
      entrered the world of sales. My interest in world of developing did not
      appear again about 3 years ago when I got into Software Sales. The
      developers of the application I was selling, showed me the world of
      developing and what you can do with it. I was eager to learn more but
      unfortunately the time was not right until now. I was presented the
      opportunity and just ran with it. The world of developing gives me the
      opportunity to be creative, think logically and problem solve. Being able
      to use technology and your noodle to present creations that folks go,
      Wowza!, or solve the problems they did not see, will be such a
      satifaction. There is a reason I am here, and I am going to show it!
